# ITC-assignment

This contains my assignment for itc.
One question (compulsory task) is present in main branch, which is directly uploaded through github website
Other questions are in master branch which i have pushed through git.
So kindly check both branches.

IMP-
For task 1 i have not uploaded node modules so to run the code first clone all files in your computer and then in VScode (or any other) terminal run the code 
-> npm install react-scripts --save

This will install the node module files and script readers then use npm start to run the code and open the website.
